1>Here we created a React.js project on a "recipe site" using API integration, and it basically holds a Home Page where all the navigation bar is there for logo, a Favorite Button, and beside that, in the body area, we have the recipe thumb image card, which is a gateway for the detailed recipe page.

2>The second stage for the favorite page is when I click on the favorite button(🤍), it turns (❤️), and the data will be set into the favorite page and and there I can list all the recipes I want. And I didn't want that card. I can just click on the (❤️) to remove the recipe from the favorite list.

3>The third stage is when I click on the "View" button, which takes me to the Recipe detail page, where I can view all the ingredients and all the instructions to cook the recipe.
